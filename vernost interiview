==>Cookies are used primarily for **storing small pieces of data** on the client side, often for maintaining **stateful information** between server requests. Since HTTP is stateless, cookies help bridge the gap by remembering data across requests. Let‚Äôs break down their key uses:

### üöÄ **Main uses of cookies:**

1. **Authentication (Sessions):**  
   - Store session tokens after login.  
   - The server uses this token to identify the user for subsequent requests.  
   - Example: `session_id=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure;`

2. **Personalization:**  
   - Save user preferences, like themes or language settings.  
   - Example: `theme=dark;`

3. **Tracking (Analytics):**  
   - Track user activity across pages (or even websites, with third-party cookies).  
   - Used by tools like Google Analytics to gather visitor data.

4. **Cart management (E-commerce):**  
   - Store temporary product data for users who haven‚Äôt logged in.  
   - Example: `cart_id=xyz456;`

5. **Security:**  
   - Secure cookies (`Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags) can help prevent XSS attacks by limiting JavaScript‚Äôs access to sensitive tokens.

6. **Cross-site requests (CSRF protection):**  
   - Cookies with `SameSite` attributes (`Strict` or `Lax`) control whether cookies are sent along with cross-site requests.

### ‚ö° **Why not use cookies for everything?**  
- **Limited storage:** Max 4KB of data.  
- **Security risks:** Vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured (e.g., XSS, CSRF).  
- **Performance:** Sent with every HTTP request, so large cookies can slow down network requests.
