### **General Notes**
- Coding must become your passion and core skill.
- Hard work is always rewarded by the universe, regardless of the situation.

### **React Redux Interview Questions**

#### **React Lazy Loading**
```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### **React Hooks**

1. **`useEffect` Behavior Without Dependencies**
   - When `useEffect` is used without any dependency, it will run after every render.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     useEffect(() => {
       console.log('This runs after every render');
     });
     ```

2. **`useEffect` Behavior With Dependencies**
   - If an empty dependency array (`[]`) is passed, the `useEffect` will only run once after the component mounts.

### **React.js Interview Questions**

1. Fetch API from JSONPlaceholder and handle quantity increment/decrement with a button.
2. Implement pagination by fetching data from an API.
3. Create a theme changer using a toggle button.
4. Write logic for the Fibonacci series.
5. Explain event delegation and provide an example.
6. Create a prototype of an object.
7. **`typeof` Examples:**
   - `let var; typeof(var); // undefined`
   - `var nullVar = null; typeof(nullVar); // object`
8. Create "Add to Cart" functionality with `useState`. Include price and total in the output.
9. Write logic to check for a palindrome.
10. Write the Fibonacci series logic.

### **Managerial Questions**

1. **What is a retrospective (retro) meeting?**
   - A meeting where team members review the completed sprint, discuss what went well, and identify areas for improvement.
   
2. **Who gives deadlines, and how are tasks managed in the team?**
   - Deadlines are typically set by managers or product owners. Tasks are assigned based on the sprint plan and tracked using tools like JIRA.

3. **How did you work through the sprint?**
   - Tasks are completed in iterative cycles, regularly reviewed, and adjusted based on priority.

### **React.js Fundamentals**

1. **React Lifecycle Phases**
   - **Mounting**: `constructor`, `render`, `componentDidMount`.
   - **Updating**: `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`.
   - **Unmounting**: `componentWillUnmount`.
   - **Error Handling**: `componentDidCatch`.

2. **Higher Order Components (HOC)**
   - A function that takes a component and returns a new component. Often used for reusability, such as authentication.

3. **Error Boundaries**
   - Components that catch JavaScript errors in their child components and display fallback UI.

4. **Synthetic Events**
   - Cross-browser wrapper for native events such as `onClick`, `onChange`, `onMouseOver`, etc.

5. **Ref in React**
   - Used to access DOM nodes or elements directly.

6. **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components**
   - **Controlled**: State is managed via `useState`.
   - **Uncontrolled**: Managed using `useRef`.

---

### **React Concepts**

1. **Immutability of State**
   - Always create a shallow copy before updating state to avoid mutating it directly.

2. **Prop Drilling**
   - Passing props through multiple levels of components.  
   - **Avoidance**: Use Context API or Redux.

3. **React Router DOM**
   - Provides navigation and routing in React applications.

4. **Pure Components**
   - Used in class-based components to prevent unnecessary renders.

5. **React.memo**
   - A higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders.

6. **Styling Techniques**
   - CSS Modules (`App.module.css`), Styled-components, Inline styles.

---

### **Advanced Topics**

1. **Lazy Loading and Code Splitting**
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
     ```

2. **Handling Asynchronous Data**
   - Use conditional rendering to display a loading spinner or fallback UI while fetching data.

3. **Challenges in React**
   - State management.
   - Handling complex forms (e.g., using Formik and Yup).
   - Creating custom hooks for reusability.

4. **`useEffect` vs. `useLayoutEffect`**
   - `useEffect`: Runs after painting.
   - `useLayoutEffect`: Runs before painting; useful for animations.

5. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Use `React.memo`, Pure Components, optimized state management, code splitting, lazy loading, and proper use of keys.
